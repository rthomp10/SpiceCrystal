# Crystal to SPICE

This is a simple and (temporarily) crude solution to converting crystal parasitic elements into useful SPICE files.

## Getting Started

Determine the parasitic elements of a crystal you have in mind. These are usually found in the data sheets like [this] one for the ABM13W IoT crystal. 

### Prerequisites

Install a SPICE program
[LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)
[MacSpice](https://www.macspice.com/Download.html)
PSpice
etc.


### Installing

GCC

## Running

Linux/OSX
1. Carefully modify the example inputs to your parameters.
2. Open terminal
3. Type *./main [drag and drop input file here]* OR just type in *./main* and input your parameters in the terminal.
4. Your done! Check out the files it made and run the test one.
